# Exercise
Nice job on getting to this point of your technical training.  To finish your git exercise you must:
1. Create a new branch from main on this Repository. Use format yyyyName for the branch name, ex: "2021Yandel".
2. Add a message to the end of the Signatures section of this ReadMe document and commit your changes.
3. Submit a pull request between your new branch with changes and main branch. Be sure to assign your tech internship lead as the pull request's reviewer.

That's it! Best of luck on the rest of your assignments!
